Accessibly Yours is a React + Next.js web app that invites users to explore accessibility with clarity, creativity, and real-time insights. It‚Äôs built to showcase best practices in frontend engineering and to spark curiosity about how thoughtful design opens experiences for everyone.

== Motivation

This app was created to:

- Demonstrate technical excellence in React, Next.js App Router, and performance-optimized architecture.
- Empower developers to uncover opportunities for better web experiences.
- Build a project that uses real-world audits and invites exploration.

== Architecture Overview

The frontend (accessibly-yours) is deployed on Vercel and communicates with a backend API (audit-api-fly) hosted on Fly.io.

Why this split?

- Vercel streamlines modern frontend deployments with static generation and SSR support.
- Fly.io enables full Node.js servers with headless browsers like Chromium‚Äîessential for real audits.

== Homepage Overview

The entry point for users to start their accessibility journey.

== Interactive Demo Experience

Explore common accessibility issues and solutions.

== Real-Time Accessibility Audits

Scan any public website to uncover accessibility insights and opportunities.


== Key Features

- üîç Scan any public website and explore accessibility opportunities
- üß™ Powered by pa11y to surface real WCAG 2.1 audit results
- üìä Export findings to CSV or JSON for further discovery
- üß† Clean, engaging UI built with Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and React

== Technology Stack

- Frontend: React 18+, Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Testing: Jest, React Testing Library
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend), Fly.io (backend with Puppeteer)
- Audit Engine: pa11y, headless Chromium

== Architecture Deep Dive

Accessibly Yours combines modern frontend architecture with real-time audit engines for a seamless and fast user experience.

=== Hosting & Deployment

Frontend: Deployed on Vercel for fast delivery of static and dynamic content using Next.js App Router.

Backend: Hosted on Fly.io inside a Docker container running Node.js + Puppeteer (Chromium headless browser) to execute real audits.

Split design ensures:

üß† Fast static site delivery for public-facing pages (Home, Demo).
‚ö° Dynamic real-time data fetches (WCAG) on demand without slowing down initial loads.

=== Data Flow

User action: scan site URL

‚Üì

Next.js page loads instantly (hydrated by React)

‚Üì

Client-side fetches:
  - Fetch WCAG issues from Fly.io backend

‚Üì

Results animated and displayed dynamically

‚Üì

Optional: Export to CSV/JSON


Both audits are performed after page load using Client-Side Rendering (CSR) to ensure snappy UX.

=== Key Technologies

- Next.js (Static Generation + Client-Side Fetching)
- Fly.io (Custom Node.js server for headless browser auditing)
- Vercel (Frontend + lightweight API routing)
- Puppeteer + pa11y (Accessibility audits inside real Chrome sessions)
- Framer Motion (Smooth React animations)
- Tailwind CSS (Responsive, accessible UI styling)
- localStorage caching (WCAG results are cached with auto-expiry to improve reload speed)

=== Terms Explained

- Static Generation (SSG): Pages built once during deploy (e.g., Home, Demo).
- Client-Side Fetching (CSR): Fetch dynamic data after the user loads the page (e.g., Results Page).
- Hydration: React attaching event listeners and state to pre-rendered HTML.
- Headless Chromium: Chrome running without a GUI to allow automated accessibility testing.
- Docker Container: Packages app + Chrome + Node.js together for smooth deployment to Fly.io.

== Setup & Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start local dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Ensure the environment points to: `https://audit-api-fly-01.fly.dev`

== Deployment

- Push to `main` branch ‚Üí auto-deploys to Vercel
- Live app: https://accessibly-yours.vercel.app

== Accessibility Principles

- Use of semantic HTML to support screen readers and keyboard navigation
- Clear visual focus indicators for all interactive elements
- Strong color contrast and scalable typography
- Designs that respect user choice and motion preferences (in-progress)
- Storytelling that celebrates curiosity, agency, and clarity

== Audit Results

*All categories scored 100 in latest Lighthouse audit (FCP: 0.3s, LCP: 0.5s, CLS: 0, TBT: 10ms).*

- üöÄ **Smart Local Storage Caching**:
  - WCAG/pa11y audit results are cached per URL.
  - Reduces network calls, improves reload speeds dramatically.

== Gotchas / Notes

- Tailwind CSS SSR hydration is needed; thus, GitHub Pages was not viable.
- All audits are proxied through the Fly.io backend to enable headless browsing.

== Future Enhancements

- ‚ú® Visualize audit results with charts and scores
- ‚ú® Offer smart fix suggestions based on audit results
- ‚ú® Progressive Web App (PWA) support for offline exploration
- ‚ú® Deepen motion accessibility for reduced-motion users
